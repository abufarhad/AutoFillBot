- **ðŸ†• Dynamic Site Addition**: Click any saved profile to autofill AND automatically add the current site to that profile

## How It Works

### Saving Form Data

1. **Fill out a form manually** on any website
2. **Click the extension icon** in the Chrome toolbar
3. **Enter a label/name** for this form profile (e.g., "Personal Info", "Work Application")
4. **ðŸ†• Optionally add additional URLs** where this profile should work (one per line)
5. **Click "Save Form Data"** to store the filled form data
6. The extension automatically captures all filled form fields and associates them with the specified URLs

### Dashboard Management (New!)

1. **Click the extension icon**
2. **Click "Manage Profiles"** button in the popup
3. **View all saved profiles** in a dedicated dashboard tab
4. **Edit any profile** by clicking the "Edit" button
5. **Modify profile details**:
   - Change profile label
   - Add/remove URLs (for site-specific profiles)
   - Edit individual form field values
   - Add or remove form fields
6. **Delete profiles** you no longer need

**Dashboard Features:**
- Clean, organized view of all profiles
- Separate sections for global and site-specific profiles
- Real-time editing with immediate save
- Field-by-field editing capabilities
- URL management for site-specific profiles

### Global Profile (New!)

1. **Fill out any form** on any website with your standard information
2. **Click the extension icon**
3. **Click "Save as Global Profile"** in the Global Profile section
4. **Visit any other site** with forms
5. **Forms automatically fill** using your global profile data
6. **Or click "Use Global Profile"** to manually trigger autofill

**Benefits of Global Profile:**
- Works on any site without configuration
- No need to manage site-specific profiles for basic information
- Perfect for personal details like name, email, phone, address
- Automatically prioritized over site-specific profiles

### Automatic Form Filling (New!)

1. **Visit any website** where you have saved form profiles
2. **The extension automatically detects** if you have matching profiles for the current site
3. **Forms are automatically filled** within 1 second of page load
4. **A notification appears** showing how many fields were auto-filled

### Dynamic Site Addition (New!)

1. **Visit a new site** where you want to use an existing form profile
2. **Click the extension icon** to see your saved profiles
3. **Click "Autofill"** next to any existing profile
4. **The extension will**:
   - Fill the form with the saved data
   - Automatically add the current site to that profile's URL list
   - Show a message confirming both actions
5. **Future visits** to this site will now automatically use this profile

This feature is perfect for:
- Using your "Personal Info" profile on a new job application site
- Applying your "Government Forms" profile to a new government portal
- Extending any existing profile to work on similar sites

### Multi-Site Support (New!)

When saving a form profile, you can specify additional URLs where the same profile should work:

```
https://example.com/login
https://sub.example.com/signin
https://another-site.com/auth
```

The extension will automatically fill forms on all these sites using the same saved data.

## Technical Details

### Permissions

- `storage`: For saving form profiles to Chrome storage
- `activeTab`: For interacting with the current active tab
- `scripting`: For injecting content scripts
- `tabs`: For listening to tab updates for automatic autofill
- `<all_urls>`: For running content scripts on all websites

### Storage Structure

Form profiles are stored in Chrome's sync storage with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "formProfiles": {
    "profile_1234567890_abc123": {
      "id": "profile_1234567890_abc123",
      "label": "My Login Profile",
      "urls": [
        "https://example.com/login.html",
        "https://sub.example.com/signin",
        "https://another-site.com/auth"
      ],
      "fields": [
        {
          "selector": "#username",
          "value": "myusername",
          "type": "text",
          "name": "username",
          "id": "username"
        }
      ],
      "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Automatic Autofill Logic

1. **Tab Update Detection**: The extension listens for `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` events
2. **URL Matching**: When a page loads, it checks if any saved profile URLs match the current page
3. **Automatic Filling**: If a match is found, the extension automatically fills the form after a 1-second delay
4. **User Notification**: A notification appears showing the number of fields filled

### URL Matching Strategy

The extension uses flexible URL matching:

1. **Exact URL match**: `https://example.com/login` matches exactly
2. **Domain + path match**: `https://example.com/login` matches `https://example.com/login?param=value`
3. **Path prefix match**: `https://example.com/app` matches `https://example.com/app/login`

### Element Matching Strategy

The extension uses a multi-layered approach to find form elements:

1. **Primary selector** (ID, name, or generated CSS selector)
2. **Name attribute** matching
3. **ID attribute** matching
4. **Placeholder attribute** matching

This ensures maximum compatibility across different websites and form structures.

### Event Triggering

After filling form fields, the extension triggers appropriate DOM events:
- `input` events for text inputs and textareas
- `change` events for all form elements
- `click` events for checkboxes and radio buttons

This ensures that dynamic forms and JavaScript validation work correctly.

## Privacy & Security

- **No data tracking**: The extension does not track your browsing or send data to external servers
- **Local storage only**: All form data is stored locally in Chrome's storage
- **Chrome Sync**: Data syncs across your Chrome browsers when signed in to Chrome
- **No password encryption**: Form data is stored as plain text, so use caution with sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Forms not auto-filling
- Check if you have saved profiles for the current site
- Verify that the URL patterns in your saved profiles match the current site
- Try refreshing the page if auto-fill doesn't work immediately

### Form fields not being detected
- Make sure the form fields have values before clicking the extension icon
- The extension only captures fields that contain data

### Manual autofill not working
- Check if the form structure has changed since you saved the profile
- Try deleting and re-saving the profile if the website has been updated
- Some dynamic forms may require manual interaction after autofill

### Extension not appearing
- Make sure Developer mode is enabled in Chrome extensions
- Check that the extension is enabled in the extensions list
- Try reloading the extension if you made any changes
